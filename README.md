# Turtle Controller
This is a turtle controller for the Minecraft Mod [CC:Tweaked](https://tweaked.cc/). This program's main purpose is to control several turtles (autonomous agents) on one world simultaneously. Features include world caching, pathfinding, strip mining, and quarrying.

If you choose to set this up on a multiplayer server, it is **ABSOLUTELY VITAL** that you completely and utterly trust the server owner and admins. They will be able to read the passwords that you setup for this! I suggest limiting your usage to private servers or servers that you control.


### Requirements
You must download [JSON.lua](https://regex.info/blog/lua/json) to every turtle running this script.
